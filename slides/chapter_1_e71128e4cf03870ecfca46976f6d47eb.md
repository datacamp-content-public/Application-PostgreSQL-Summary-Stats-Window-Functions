Hello, welcome to the course 
In this course you are going to learn about Window Functions


---
## What are Window Functions?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "835e9ad186"
```

`@part1`
- Window functions are a tool to perform advanced queries for reporting and analytics. 
- They allow you to do complex sorting on a subset of rows.  
- You can use them to solve query problems in a smooth, very readable, flexible and efficient way.
- Mastering them is one of the best investments you can make on your analytics career. 
- Because they are defined in the SQL Standard, most database vendors include them, even in big data platform like Spark and Hive PTF.

## **What can I do with Window Functions?**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "7f7ec1c9db"
```

`@part1`
Some of the most popular business problems you can solve with Window Functions

- Top N per group analysis
- Running totals
- Moving averages
- Percentages over a group
- Growth over a period
- Rankings
- Dealing with duplicate data
- Pivot and unpivoting data
- Paging records in applications

## **Comparing Window Functions with Traditional Alternatives**

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d6d89ecbd6"
disable_transition: false
```

`@part1`
**Let's start with an example**

```sql
SELECT database_name, batch_date, size_mb
FROM mssql.database_size curr
LIMIT 10
```{{1}}

## The Traditional Way

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a69cab9332"
```

`@part1`
Some traditional methods used to solve complex queries are: 
- Cursors
- Self-joins
- Correlated subqueries

Let's try with the last one


`@script`

## The Traditional Way

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "70b3f975ca"
```

`@part1`
```SQL
SELECT database_name, batch_date, size_mb
	,(SELECT size_mb FROM mssql.database_size AS prev
		WHERE prev.database_name = curr.database_name 
        AND prev.batch_date < curr.batch_date
		ORDER BY batch_date DESC 
		LIMIT 1) 
		AS prev_date	
FROM mssql.database_size curr

```{{1}}

## But...what about the performance?

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c59e92e64b"
```

`@part1`

Using the PostgreSQL Explain Plan tool, you can see that the query execution time was _22 milliseconds_.

## Using LAG Window Function

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b6b39c3ec6"
```

`@part1`
LAG is one of the most popular functions. 

You use it to include a column from another row in your results. 

```sql
SELECT database_name, batch_date, size_mb	
	,LAG(size_mb) 
		OVER(PARTITION BY database_name ORDER BY batch_date) AS prev_size	
FROM mssql.database_size
```

`@script`

## Let's see if it's performant

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f011a782c0"
```

`@part1`

The query elapsed only _5 milliseconds_. 4 times faster!

## Conclusion

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a6497a3896"
```

`@part1`
The Window Function version is

- Simple
- Elegant
- Efficient
- More readable
